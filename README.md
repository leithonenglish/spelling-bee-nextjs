# Spelling Bee

A clone of [The New York Times Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) that I tried for fun.

It's just like the old Spelling Bee with a few tweaks:

1. You can start over at any time
2. The cursor can be moved anywhere in the textbox
3. The words are completely random (and kinda hard too if I'm being honest)
4. Minor style changes

Give it a try and tell me what you think!
